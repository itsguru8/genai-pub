          "Issue Description": "During auto integration (LMT integration) the system tries to take a backup on the node.
In the log :
Create Backup Failed 2017-11-22 12:13:57.003 Exception occured while Creating Backup: Failure reason: Backup Mo with Backup Name VtfRadioNode release upgrade package_22112017_121124_INTEGRATION_COMPLETE is not found. backupName : VtfRadioNode release upgrade package_22112017_121124_INTEGRATION_COMPLETE
I suspect that the name of the backup could be the problem. Name contains spaces which the node can handle but when using SHM to create a backup it is not possible.",
          "Impact": "Though backup is created on node, exported the same to ENM(SMRS) could not be possible",
          "Resolution Details": "ITTE team has agreed to re-install the system as current one is unstable."
