Detailed problem description:{color}*\n\n\nsecserv has been observed to be sending very large (~70KB+) messages towards Log transformer (LT).Due to the large size of these logs, they are trimmed and end up as malformed JSON strings (i.e.without a matching closing bracket), which cannot be parsed by Log Transformer.As a result, these logs are not parsed by LT and never end up stored in Elasticsearch.
Additionally, LT writes these messages to its own container logs, and it is the combination of the size & rate of these that is causing issues with LT in addition to incurring a higher performance cost.\n\nI have attached an example LT log that includes the original secserv log.\n\nThese logs appear to be a long list of configuration parameters in XML format - the value of which should be clarified ideally as they come with a higher processing cost than most other logs. If there is a requirement for these logs to be kept in, perhaps they should be split up into chunks and sent in batches in order to avoid the issue entirely and ensure they are correctly handled by LT and stored by Elasticsearch.\n\n*{color:#d04437}2.Expected behaviour or results:{color}*\n\n\nIn general, the expectation is for applications to avoid sending very large logs (e.g.stack traces/user or node lists) to Log Transformer in order for them to be processed adequately.
The [+Java coding guidelines+|https://-oss.seli.wh.rnd.internal..com/display/Classic/Java+Coding+Guidelines] for example specify that collections should not be printed directly (Logging guidelines #11), which appears to be the case in this situation.\n\nThe value these logs bring is usually not well stated (e.g. stack traces) either, so it would be beneficial if they were removed/kept to a minimum.Crucially, since these very large secserv logs never make it to Elasticsearch, if they are absolutely required changes should be made to their size to ensure they can be processed by LT.Otherwise, they should be removed if they provide no meaningful value to users/customers.\n\n*{color:#d04437}3.Activity and/or conditions during which this bug was found:{color}*\n\n\nThis issue has been observed on all c XL servers with load.\n\n*{color:#d04437}4.Tester impact :{color}*\n\n\nIncluded above.\n\n*{color:#d04437}5.
Potential Customer and/or System impact :{color}* \n\n\nAs a result of these logs being malformed JSON, they are not processed by Log Transformer and will not end up being stored in Elasticsearch. Therefore, a customer would be missing whatever information they would bring.\n\nLastly, there is a higher cost associated with parsing these types of very large logs in LT, so removing/reducing these would net performance gains in Log Transformer as well.\n\n*{color:#d04437}6.Frequency of Fault{color}*\n\n\nThis issue is always seen on loaded c XL servers.\n\n*{color:#d04437}7.Troubleshooting completed:{color}*\n\n\nWe have done an analysis into the different SGs that are seen to be sending very large malformed JSON logs towards Log Transformer, and have identified secserv as one of the contributors to this issue, with these logs being generated daily on most XL c server.\n\n*{color:#d04437}8.
